# Advent of Code 2020
[Click here](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

## Explanation
This is my personal repository of my answers to the Advent of Code 2020 challenges. I'll try to include the puzzle prompt in the file and any necessary files provided to run the solutions on your own computer. Most solutions will be written in Python, unless otherwise notes.

## To Run Each Solution
*If solution file is in Python:* `python3 path/to/file.py`

You should not have to put any input in the command line past that to run each file.

Thanks for checking this out! If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
