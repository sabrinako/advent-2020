# Advent of Code 2020

## Explanation
This is my personal repository of my answers to the Advent of Code 2020 challenges. Please check the link above to read the corresponding prompt for each solution file and any necessary files will be in the same folder as the solution file. Most solutions will be written in Python, unless otherwise noted.

## To Run Each Solution
*If solution file is in Python: run this command in the folder for that day* `python3 solution.py`

You should not have to put any input in the command line past that to run each file.

Thanks for checking this out! If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
